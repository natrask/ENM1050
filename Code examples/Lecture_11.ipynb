Now that we're moving towards developing standalone apps and interacting with robots you will need to maintain your own environment on your own laptop. This will be a little painful for folks who are relatively new to using computers beyond email/internet/microsoft office. Please make full use of office hours to get help as needed - we are building in a little buffer before the next HW for you to take care of this, but \"I couldn't get vscode up on my machine\" will not be an accepted excuse for the next HW."
