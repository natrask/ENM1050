Unlike the usual lectures, I will step through this and code it in real time from the front of the room, and suggest folks pop open the notebook and type in the same results - you will be able to more or less tweak this to complete Monday's homework. If you feel confident, feel free to grab your partner and work through this in the back of the room on your own, or to jump directly to the homework and work on that."
