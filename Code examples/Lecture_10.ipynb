        "   - This construct allows you to define code that should only run when the script is executed directly, such as test code or the main application logic.\n",

You should make multiple objects that bounce around the screen, each initialized to show a picture of a rock, paper, or scissors. To do this cleanly, we will define a base class **bouncy_object** which contains a position, and a function to draw a default image. You will then define inherited rock, paper and scissors classes. When two images collide, their velocity should be flipped and they should both get switched into the same class (i.e. if a rock hits a paper, they should both turn into paper).\n",
