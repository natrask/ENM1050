        "Today we will step through some of the basics of discretizing differential equations to build up simulators of dynamical systems. You can view this as a dry run for the homework due Monday. Unlike the usual lectures, I will step through this and code it in real time from the front of the room, to make sure folks with less programming background get a chance to see what good programming practices look like. If you feel confident, feel free to grab your partner and work through this in the back of the room, or to jump directly to the homework and work on that."
